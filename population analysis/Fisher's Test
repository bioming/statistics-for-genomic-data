## Fisher's Exact Test: estimate the significance of allele frequency differences
    (originated from popoolation)
    
The Fishers exact test can be used to test whether any differences in allele 
frequencies are statistically significant. At low coverages the absolute changes
of allele frequencies or the Fst values may be strongly influenced by sampling 
effects, therefore the Fishers exact test may be used to identify significant 
changes in allele frequency.
